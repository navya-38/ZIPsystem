A new location ‘Out of Country/Canada’ needs to be added to the Accident & Sickness   
Module.  
There are out of town insureds that are purchasing insurance but should not be taxed on   
them as they are not residents of Canada. When the policies are coded, locations are   
created and coded under 12 different provinces. Since these insureds are not residents of   
Canada, there should be no tax on their premium so the locations should not be listed   
under provinces.  
There needs to be a location that is created that does not identify a province and should   
only be for out of country.
